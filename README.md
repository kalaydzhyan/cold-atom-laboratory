# Simulations of Bose-Einstein Condensates in microgravity

For description  of the problem and preliminary results read **writeup.pdf**

# latekick.m

Matlab routine for simulation of BEC released from a magnetic trap. Delta-kick is applied at 100 ms.

# earlykick.m 

Same for the 10 ms kick.

# adiabatic.m

Simulation of the adiabatic cooling, initial trap frequency 1kHz, going down to about 1Hz.
